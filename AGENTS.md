# Agent Instructions

## Deployment

After making any changes to the theme, run this command to deploy it to Windsurf:

```bash
cp -r ~/Desktop/Projects/windsurf-theme-dark ~/.windsurf/extensions/
cp -r ~/Desktop/Projects/windsurf-theme-dark ~/.windsurf-insiders/extensions/
```

This copies the theme to both the Windsurf and Windsurf Insiders extensions folders so changes are reflected in the IDE.
